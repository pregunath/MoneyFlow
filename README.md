# MoneyFlow App

## Description
MoneyFlow is an all-in-one finance management app designed for individual users and families. It provides features like expense tracking, financial goal setting, real-time currency exchange rates, stock portfolio management, and AI-powered financial recommendations. The app was developed as a team project in the Software Development Practices class, where it earned an **Honorable Mention** for its comprehensive features and functionality.

The app was built with a focus on **backend functionality**, while future development will aim at enhancing the **frontend design**. The app was developed using Java, Android Studio, and several third-party libraries for PDF parsing, chat integration, and AI-driven recommendations using OpenAI’s GPT.

## Future Plans and Development
The database used during the project was initially provided by the class but is no longer available. I plan to:
- **Develop a new custom database** to support the app.
- **Enhance the frontend design** to create a more modern and user-friendly interface.
- **Refactor backend code** for scalability and additional features.

I will include:
- A **video demonstration** of the app in action.
- **Screenshots** of the app receiving an **Honorable Mention** and me being recognized as one of the best managers in the class.
